# Speech-to-text Research with Transformer

## Background
A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) .\
Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format.

## Aim of this project
* Learning Transformer architecture with a speech-to-text task
* Hands on public speech-to-text transformer models
* Benchmark public models against these models
